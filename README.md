# Mental-Health-in-Tech
**Dataset:** OSMI Mental health in tech survey-2016<br />
**Preprocess.ipynb:**<br />
Ensure that the following packages are installed and working:<br /> 
- pandas<br />
- numpy<br />
- seaborn<br />
- matplotlib<br />
- Sklearn<br />
- Warnings<br />
- plotly<br />
The code can be divided into 3 segments:<br />
- Data cleaning and preprocessing<br />
  - All column names are shortened and renamed to more accessible ones<br />
  - All columns having>50% NA are dropped<br />
  - Columns are encoded <br />
  - NA values are filled<br />
- Visualization<br />
  - Plot showing number of people who open about about illness in developed countries, different regions<br />
  - Proportions of gender based by region<br />
  - Mental health coverage provided by companies based on number of employees<br />
  - Benefit of conducting programs to address mental health in the workplace<br />
  - Employee awareness of coverage options<br />
  - Difficulties faced by employees in obtaining leave due to mental health issues<br />
  - Importance given to mental health<br />
  - Employer statistics<br />
  - Experience with previous employers<br />
  - Willingness to discuss mental health<br />
 - Correlation and ch-square tests<br />
  - Correlation and chi-square test between Mental health coverage provided by the company and the employee's comfort of discussing about their mental health with the supervisors<br />
  - Correlation and chi-square test between awareness of coverage and comfort in discussing with supervisor<br />
  - Correlation and chi-square test between help provided by previous employers and whether mental health was taken seriously<br />

**Mental_health_code.ipynb:**
<br />
Packages required:<br />
Same as preprocess.ipynb<br /> 

The code can be divided into 5 parts: <br />
- Preprocessing:<br />
  - Same as in preprocess.ipynb <br />
- KNN classifier:<br />
  - Splits the dataset into test and train <br />
  - Uses the diagnosis column as target <br />
  - Plots training and testing scores for different values of K to find optimum K <br />
  - Builds a classifier which predicts whether a person is likely be diagnosed as having a mental health issue or not<br />
  - Accuracy calculation<br />
- KMeans clustering:<br />
 - Performs K-means clustering on dataset to find optimum number of clusters using Elbow method and calinski harabasz score<br />
 - Perform clustering and check goodness using silhouette score and visualizer<br />
 - Plot the clustering for optimum k<br />
- Risk Classification<br />
 - Use columns columns on diagnosis and current mental health for each point in the different clusters to classify clusters as high, low and medium risk<br />
- Inferences<br />
 - Instances of Family history for people at different levels of risk<br />
 - Distribution of positive diagnoses among the three classes<br />
 - Levels of risk for people who donâ€™t open up about their illness<br />
 - Risk levels for remote and non-remote workers<br />
 - Impact of negative reaction in workplace<br />
